Whenever you want to associate different data sets with different Y-axes, you'd have to use
`Layers <https://wikis.cern.ch/display/ACCPY/Graphs#Graphs-Layerconcept>`__. This is
`accwidgets <https://wikis.cern.ch/display/ACCPY/Graphs>`__ concept and is set up similarly. In ComRAD Designer,
right-click on the widget and choose menu "Edit Axes..." to define new layers. Afterwards, associate layers with curves
in the Plotting Item editor.
