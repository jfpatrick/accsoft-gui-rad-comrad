              'permanent or not. A permanent plugin does not get overlapped by status messages. The following ' \
              'example creates two plugins: temporary and permanent, which are simple labels. To observe the ' \
              'difference, try to trigger a status message (e.g. File->Reload Display menu will produce a temporary ' \
              'status message "Reloading <filename>", which will overlap and cover the temporary plugin, but will be ' \
              'hidden behind the permanent one.'
